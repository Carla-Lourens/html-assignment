# Wedding Website – Visual Styling Documentation

## Purpose of Visual Styling

The visual styling of this wedding website was designed to create a warm, romantic, and elegant experience for visitors. The goal was to reflect the personal and emotional nature of a wedding while maintaining readability and modern design principles.

- **Colors**: Soft pastel tones (such as blush pinks `#a85664` and muted blues `#a4becd`) were chosen to evoke a sense of romance and calmness. The accent color `#793149` offers a rich contrast.
- **Typography**: The serif font `'Georgia'` adds a classic and formal tone appropriate for a wedding, enhancing elegance while still being highly legible.
- **Layout**: A centered, content-focused layout with ample white space ensures the content feels personal and uncluttered. Flexbox is used for navigation to keep the layout responsive and visually balanced.

## Supporting the Portfolio Theme

This website is part of a wedding portfolio. Every stylistic choice supports a cohesive theme of romance, warmth, and simplicity. By using consistent color palettes, gentle transitions, and classic typography, the site aligns well with the joy and intimacy of a wedding celebration. The layout ensures focus stays on the love story and event details, without distraction.

## Stylesheet Validation

The CSS file was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors were found. 

## Challenges
- A challenge was finding a balance between aesthetic beauty and accessibility — making sure there was enough contrast for readability while still using soft, wedding-appropriate colors.

## Decisions
- I decided to use an `<a>` tag styled as a button for navigation, as it semantically fits a link to another page and allows better keyboard accessibility.
- Using inline `style="text-align: center;"` in a few places was a quick decision to maintain alignment, though in future iterations, separating this into the CSS file would improve maintainability.
