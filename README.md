# Jonny & Lisa Wedding Website

This is a basic one-page wedding website created as part of my Front-End Web Development assignment. It is designed to share important details about the wedding and give guests a preview of the couple’s story and celebration.

## Purpose of Each Major Section

- **`<header>` and `<nav>`:**  
  Contains the main navigation menu, allowing users to easily browse between sections of the website, including Home, Our Story, Wedding Party, Details, and RSVP.

- **`<main>`:**  
 Currently there are two seperate sections within the main body. 
  1. A **hero image** and announcement (`<img>` and `<h1>`) with the wedding date and venue. Accompanied by a **call-to-action button** that   links to the wedding details page.
  2. An **"Our Story" section**, which shares a brief narrative about Jonny & Lisa’s relationship journey.

- **`<footer>`:**  
  A fun closing element with a celebratory message ("Let's party!") to end the page on a light-hearted note.

## Multimedia Integration

The website uses two key image files:
- `Engagementimage4.jpg`: Displayed near the top as a welcoming image of the couple.
- `Engagementimage8.jpg`: Displayed below the story to add visual interest and sentiment.

Alt text is included for accessibility and descriptive purposes.

## Theme Choice

For this project I have decided to go with a professional/business portfolio to start building examples of the service I could one day offer clients. 

## Future Plans

This is the initial version of the site, with future plans to expand into a multi-page website including more wedding details, an RSVP form, and profiles of the wedding party.
